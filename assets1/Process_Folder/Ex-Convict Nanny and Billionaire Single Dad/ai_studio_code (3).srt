00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The auctioneer's hammer falls. "Sold!" The sound echoes as Zhang Shao and his father erupt in triumphant laughter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But their celebration is cut short. The grand doors of the hall swing open, and Lin Feng enters. He is no longer the humble deliveryman, but a king returning to his court, flanked by imposing bodyguards, his presence silencing the entire room.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A wave of shock ripples through the crowd. The faces of Zhang Shao and his father are frozen in masks of disbelief and dawning horror. How could he be here? What does this mean?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lin Feng ascends the stage and takes the microphone. His voice, calm and steady, carries an authority that commands absolute attention. He announces his true purpose: a personal bid of five billion, not for the project, but for the complete and total acquisition of the entire Zhang Corporation.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The words hit like a physical blow. The elder Zhang clutches his chest, collapsing from the shock, his empire crumbling before his very eyes. His son can only watch, paralyzed by the sheer scale of his defeat.

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:40,000
News travels fast. Hearing of her ex-lover's unimaginable power and her new benefactor's ruin, the ex-girlfriend comes running. She throws herself at Lin Feng's feet, her face streaked with tears of regret, begging for a second chance she knows she doesn't deserve.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
At that moment, a figure of quiet grace appears. It is Lin Feng's true wife, the woman who stood by him through everything. She says nothing, simply draping a coat over his shoulders in a gesture of unwavering love and support.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lin Feng gently shields his wife, his gaze finally settling on the pathetic woman on the floor. His words are not angry, but they are final. He speaks of loyalty, of the one who was there in the darkness, delivering the final, crushing judgment on the one who only chased the light.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Security guards arrive to remove the hysterical ex. Lin Feng and his wife turn and walk away, their clasped hands a symbol of a bond forged in adversity, leaving the ruins of the past behind them.
