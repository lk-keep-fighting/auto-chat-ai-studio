00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
The moment of ultimate humiliation arrives... as a glass of red wine washes away his last shred of dignity.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:19,050
This is Lin Feng. Dressed in a humble delivery uniform, he stands alone amidst the glittering luxury of a class reunion. Every corner of the opulent hall seems to mock his presence, and every glance from his former classmates feels like a sharp, silent judgment on the man he has become.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:31,050
But he isn't here for pleasantries. A message illuminates his screen, a stark reminder from the hospital... His daughter's life hangs in the balance, tied to a surgical fee that feels like an impossible mountain to climb. This is the true weight upon his shoulders.

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:41,050
Across the room, his ex-girlfriend clings to her new prize, the wealthy heir, Zhang Shao. Her eyes, once filled with affection, now hold nothing but cold, dismissive contempt for the man she left behind.

5
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:56,050
Zhang Shao, enjoying the spectacle, pulls out a thick stack of cash. With a cruel smirk, he throws it to the floor, the bills scattering like fallen leaves. The unspoken command is clear: crawl for it. Beg for these scraps.

6
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:16,050
His ex adds her own venomous words, twisting the knife of his past failures. She recounts her decision to leave him as the best choice she ever made, her voice dripping with scorn, ensuring his shame is absolute and public. Every word is a hammer blow to his pride.

7
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:34,050
We watch as a storm gathers within Lin Feng. His hands clench into fists, veins bulging with suppressed rage. His gaze shifts from quiet suffering, through a flicker of desperate struggle, and finally settles into a chilling, unbreakable coldness. The man who endured is gone.

8
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:49,050
He lifts his head, his voice low but laced with steel, a promise delivered to his tormentors. "You will pay," he vows, "for this arrogance." The air crackles with the weight of his declaration.

9
00:01:49,050 --> 00:02:04,050
Ignoring the scattered money and mocking laughter, he turns his back on them. He raises a phone to his ear, his profile now a mask of cold fury. A single, chilling command is given: "Begin." The game has just changed.
