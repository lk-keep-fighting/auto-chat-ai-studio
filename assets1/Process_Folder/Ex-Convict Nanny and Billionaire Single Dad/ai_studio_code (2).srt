00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
A close-up on a man's face, contorted in pure, undiluted terror. His eyes are locked on his phone screen as if seeing a ghost.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The story rewinds slightly. Zhang Shao, still basking in his petty victory, makes a call with smug satisfaction. His order is simple and cruel: fire Lin Feng, and make sure he never works in this city again.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The delivery manager, eager to please the wealthy heir, receives the command with obsequious nods. Filled with borrowed power, he marches towards Lin Feng, his expression a mask of arrogant authority, ready to deliver the final blow to the seemingly helpless man.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But just as he prepares to speak, fate intervenes. The sharp ring of his personal phone cuts through the air, a sound that will alter the course of his life forever.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He glances at the caller ID. The arrogance on his face instantly dissolves, replaced by a wave of disbelief, then sheer panic. His hand begins to tremble uncontrollably. This is not a call he can ignore. This is a call from the very top of the corporate empire, from the chairman himself.

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:23,000
With a shaking hand, he answers. We don't hear the words, but we see them reflected in his eyes. His face drains of all color. Beads of cold sweat form on his brow. The silent fury coming through the receiver is enough to shatter his entire world.

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The call ends. The manager's legs give out from under him. With a sickening thud, he falls to his knees directly in front of Lin Feng, the ultimate gesture of submission and terror.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A broken sob escapes his lips as he begins to kowtow frantically. "Chairman Lin," he stammers, the title hanging in the stunned silence. "I was blind... I didn't know... Please forgive me!" The truth is revealed.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Lin Feng looks down at the groveling man, his expression unreadable, his voice dangerously calm. "You were saying," he asks, "...you wanted to fire someone?"
